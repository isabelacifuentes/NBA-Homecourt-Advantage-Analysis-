# 🏀 NBA Homecourt Advantage Analysis

This project explores the impact of **homecourt advantage** in the NBA using historical data, player stats, and advanced analytics.  
Our goal is to measure how factors like **fan presence, travel schedules, and game location** influence team performance.

## 📊 Features
- Data collection from official NBA stats APIs and Kaggle datasets  
- Cleaning, preprocessing, and integration of multi-season data  
- Statistical models (regression & hypothesis testing) to evaluate win probability  
- Machine learning models to identify patterns in performance differences  
- Visualizations (Python & R) for team and player trends  
- Capstone project developed at Florida Atlantic University  

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nba_api)  
- **R** (ggplot2, dplyr)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for analysis and visualizations  
- **HTML/CSS** for project website and dashboards  

## 👥 Team
This project was developed by our Capstone team at FAU:  
- Isabela Cifuentes (Project Lead, Data Science)  
- [Add your teammates + roles here]

## 📈 Outcomes
- Quantified **homecourt advantage pre- and post-COVID empty stadiums**  
- Identified statistical significance of home vs away win differentials  
- Produced dashboards and CSV datasets for reproducible research  

## 🚀 Future Work
- Incorporate more advanced predictive models (XGBoost, Deep Learning)  
- Expand dataset to include referee calls, crowd attendance, and betting spreads  
- Deploy interactive web dashboard for real-time NBA stats
